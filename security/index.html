        <h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of <i>Ride-Hailing Service</i></h2>
        <h2>Introduction</h3>
            To assess the security and privacy of Ride-Hailing Service, I exploited the website after reviewing the source code server-vuln.js.
        <h2>Methodology</h3>
            The website is lacking validation of user's input, so I tried to hack into the website by sending data with the purposes of Database Injection and Cross-site Scripting.
        <h2>Abstract of Findings</h3>
            The website can be easily injected in malicious scripts and the privacy of passengers and vehilces are leaked. User's input validation/sanitization is in urgent need!
        <h2>Issues Found</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Database injection at /passenger.json
                    <ul>
                        <li>Severity: medium => all passengers' data are leaked, no sensitive though</li>
                        <li>https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username=%27%20or%20%271%27=%271</li>
                        <li><img src="1.png" width="70%"></li>
                        <li>Resolution: Escape whitespaces, '\', '/', '=' and quotations. <br>Pseudo-code: <code>username = Array.from(username, c => (c in [" ", "'", '"', "\\", "\/", "="]) ? c : "").join("")</code>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Database injection at /vehicle.json
                    <ul>
                        <li>Severity: medium => all vehicles' data are leaked, no sensitive though</li>
                        <li>https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username=%27%20or%20%271%27=%271</li>
                        <li><img src="2.png" width="70%"></li>
                        <li>Resolution: Escape whitespaces, '\', '/', '=' and quotations. <br>Pseudo-code: <code>username = Array.from(username, c => (c in [" ", "'", '"', "\\", "\/", "="]) ? c : "").join("")</code>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cross-site Scripting at /rides
                    <ul>
                        <li>Severity: high => the index page is taken control by an alert window that keeps showing</li>
                        <li>Description: by sending the data below into passenger's database while cheking in, the index page is inserted the scrip that keeps poping up the alert window</li>
                        <li><img src="4.png" height="20%"></li>
                        <li>Result: Nothing can be loaded because of the annoying alert window. <img src="3.png" width="70%"></li>
                        <li>Resolution: For example, username should be only consist of letters and numbers with maximum length of 10.</li>Pseudo-code: <code>if ((username).some(characher => characher in ['<', '>', '\', '/', '?']) || username.length > 10) { throws error; } else{ ... }</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Maintainer of the Ride-Hailing Service should make an effort to make constraint on what user's input is allowed. The easy way to do this is to use ORM that uses object-oriented programming language for database manipulation instead of SQL, which helps escaping SQL injection, and a front-end framework that escapes Cross-site Scripting by design.</p>
